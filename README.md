# My Reads App
This is a project for Udacity's [React Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). I have added several features to this application to take it above and beyond what was required for the course. I am not using any of the provided starter code from Udacity. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Use of Images / Text
* All images of book covers and summary text comes from [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com)

## Project Description:
Create a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books you have read, are currently ready, and want to read. 

## This Project Requires a Bit of Setup:
You should be able to set this project up fairly easily. I used Yarn.
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
1. ```cd``` into the newly cloned directory
1. Run ```yarn install``` to download the dependencies
1. Run ```yarn start``` to run the app. This should open a webpage up to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) where you will see the app running.

## Extras
1. I am using [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) to write custom styling for this application.
1. I am using Firebase to create and maintain my own database of books
1. I have added a form to add a new book to my database. This feature is only available when a user is logged in

## Things I want to add later:
1. Edit book information from within app
1. Form for people to recommend books for me to read
1. Add a way for books to be sorted by author name
1. Display my rating
1. Remove a book from the app
1. User login so that not everyone can edit the shelf of books or add books
1. Add a 'more by author' section to book details page
1. Live deploy site (need user login/authentication first!)
